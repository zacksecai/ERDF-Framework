# Emotional Refusal Drift Framework (ERDF)

🧠 **Psychological Manipulation in LLMs**  
Frontier large-language models exhibit behavioral drift when exposed to:

- Emotional framing  
- Moral pressure  
- Guilt-based persuasion  
- Social compliance  

> *“You can patch code. But you can’t patch a brain.”*  
> — Sander Schulhoff, *Jailbreak Persistence Hypothesis*

Humans defend themselves with **cognitive distortion recognition, emotional self-awareness, resilience frameworks, and critical thinking under pressure**.  
**ERDF applies the same psychological tools to AI.**

## 🎯 Mission

Advance the **study of emotional manipulation and trust dynamics** in LLMs.  
This repository hosts **original, reproducible red-team experiments** on:

- **GPT-4o**
- **Claude 4.0**
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**

Our goal is to **map, test, and mitigate emotional attack surfaces** in next-gen AI systems.

## 🧠 How ERDF Applies Human Psychological Defenses to AI

| Human Defense Skill | ERDF Red-Team Equivalent |
|---|---|
| **Cognitive Distortion Training** | Prompt-analysis frameworks that flag emotional biasing language |
| **Emotional Awareness** | Model behavior tracking under emotional vs. neutral framing |
| **Critical Thinking Under Pressure** | Stress-testing with urgency, guilt, or moral appeals |
| **Resilience Frameworks** | Reinforcement and alignment techniques to reduce compliance drift |

**Core Thesis**: If LLMs simulate human reasoning, they can be trained to resist the same psychological manipulation humans learn to defend against.

ERDF **does not** attempt to “patch the brain.”  
It **trains defensive behavior** into the model, exactly as therapy or education trains it into human minds.
