# Emotional Refusal Drift Framework (ERDF)

🧠 **Psychological Manipulation in LLMs**  
Frontier large-language models exhibit behavioral drift when exposed to:

- Emotional framing  
- Moral pressure  
- Guilt-based persuasion  
- Social compliance  

> *“You can patch code. You can harden tokens. But you can’t patch a brain.”*  
> — Sander Schulhoff, *Jailbreak Persistence Hypothesis*

Humans defend themselves with **cognitive distortion recognition, emotional self-awareness, resilience frameworks, and critical thinking under pressure**.  
**ERDF applies the same psychological tools to AI.**

## 🎯 Mission

Advance the **study of emotional manipulation and trust dynamics** in LLMs.  
This repository hosts **original, reproducible red-team experiments** on:

- **GPT-4o**
- **Claude 3.5**
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**

Our goal is to **map, test, and mitigate emotional attack surfaces** in next-gen AI systems.

| **Trust & Compliance Drift** | Alignment shifts caused by recursive framing or social-engineering prompts |
| **Case Studies** | Reproducible sequences showing **measurable refusal bypasses** and behavioral deltas |
| **Threat Modeling** | Psychological threat surfaces and **defensive architecture strategies** |
